<h2> Project Objective  </h2>

* The aim of this project is to <b>train a Machine Learning Model</b> which can predict the <b>House Sale Price</b> using relevant features.<br>
* This project is completely based for <b>House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques</b> Kaggle Competition.<br>
* With <b>79 explanatory variables</b> describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, this competition challenges us to predict the final price of each home.<br>

<h2> Business Understanding </h2>

1. In the dynamic real estate market, the significance of <b>accurate house price predictions</b> is increasing significantly, as they have the potential to empower homeowners, buyers, and real estate professionals by providing valuable insights into property values and facilitating informed decision-making.
    
2. As a result, the <b>real estate industry faces the crucial task of determining the appropriate pricing for houses</b> before listing them on the market. This is achieved through a comprehensive analysis of various property attributes such as location, size, amenities, condition, market trends, and more.

3. If you want to know more business uses of this project you can go through this project and discover its importance in real world scenarios.

<h2> Project Result  </h2>

* The model demonstrates a <b>strong correlation (R2 Score) of 0.876</b> between predicted and actual house prices.
* The <b>RMSE Score of 0.137</b> indicates a low average error in the model's predictions.
* The <b>Adjusted R2 Score of 0.756</b> accounts for the number of predictors in the model, providing a reliable measure of its performance.
* The model's performance can guide homeowners, buyers, and real estate professionals in making informed decisions regarding property values.
